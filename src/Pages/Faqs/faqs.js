          <h4>Would I have to pay to enroll for the training?</h4>
          <p>
            No, the program is completely free thanks to Ingressive For Good
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>What are the things I would need to participate?</h4>
          <p>
            You'll need a laptop, internet connection and the willingness to
            learn through collaboration and mentorship.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>What happens if i join and Iâ€™m not active?</h4>
          <p>
            Participants who join the program and stop engaging will be given
            the chance to catch up. You'll also be assigned a 'study-mate' and
            mentor to help you. However, there is the possibility of not being
            promoted to the next stage if you remain inactive for too long
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>
            Can I switch from the part-time track to full-time and vice versa?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, no, you cannot switch from part-time to full-time and
            vice-versa
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Will I get paid?</h4>
          <p>
            We reward some participants who complete tasks early, however, this
            is not a weekly reward. All the work that will be done during the
            program are hypothetical.
